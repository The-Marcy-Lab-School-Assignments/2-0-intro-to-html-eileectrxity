# Question 3
Where do html attributes go?

# Answer
Attributes add additional information about HTML elements and are always listed in the opening tag. Best practices when using attributes are always using quotes around them for interpretation and making them lowercase for consistency. To explain more, there are two types of attributes in HTML: global attributes and element-specific attributesâ€”see below for their examples.

**Global attributes** include those that can be used with any HTML element to provide additional information or functionality, such as `id`, `class`, `style`, and `title`.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" title="Image Title"> <!--title is not specific to anything-->
<div id="header">This is the header</div> <!--id is not specific to anything-->
<p class="highlighted">This text is highlighted</p> <!--class is not specific to anything-->
<div style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">Styled text</div> <!--style is not specific to anything-->

```

On the other hand, **element-specific attributes** are unique to their specific elements. This means they can only be used with their associated element. For instance, `href` is an element-specific attribute for `<a>` elements, `src` is for `<img>` elements, and `alt` is for `img` elements as well.

```html
<html lang="en"> <!--lang is specific to a html-->
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example Website</a> <!--href is specific to a-->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image"> <!--src and alt are specific to img-->
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name"> <!--type is specific to input-->

```

As you can see, in all these examples, the attributes only go in the opening tags.
