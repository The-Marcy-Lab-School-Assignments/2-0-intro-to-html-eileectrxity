# Question 1
What's the difference between "semantic" and "non-semantic" elements?

# Answer
The difference between semantic and non-semantic elements is that non-semantic elements tell us nothing about their contents, while semantic elements do. Semantic elements are named with their function- examples include: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

Meanwhile, non-semantic elements are not named and have no meaning- their function is solely for grouping other related tags or grabbing parts of the text. Examples include: `<div>` and `<span>`.
